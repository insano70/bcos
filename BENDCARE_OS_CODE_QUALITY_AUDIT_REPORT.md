## Detailed Findings

### Critical Findings

#### QUAL-001: Extensive Use of `any` Types

**Severity:** Critical  
**Category:** Code Quality / Type Safety  
**Priority Score:** 140  
**Location:** Multiple files across `lib/`, `app/`, `components/`  
**Effort:** 16 hours

**Description:**
Found 41 instances of `any` type usage throughout the codebase, directly violating the project's strict TypeScript standards. This represents a significant type safety risk and potential source of runtime errors.

**Impact:**
- **Technical:** Loss of type safety, potential runtime errors, reduced IDE support, harder refactoring
- **Business:** Increased bug risk, higher maintenance costs, potential production issues

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Examples found:
lib/db/work-item-fields-schema.ts: field_config: jsonb('field_config'), // {value: any}[]
app/(default)/dashboard/fintech/fintech-card-01.tsx: backgroundColor: function (context: any) {
app/(default)/dashboard/dashboard-card-05.tsx: data.forEach((v: any, i: number) => {
```

**Recommendation:**
1. Create proper type definitions for all data structures
2. Use `unknown` instead of `any` when type is truly unknown
3. Implement type guards for runtime type checking
4. Enable ESLint rule to prevent new `any` usage
5. Conduct systematic refactoring sprint to eliminate all instances

**Description:**
Found 192 instances of direct `console.*` usage instead of the project's structured logging system. This violates logging standards and prevents proper log aggregation, correlation tracking, and PII sanitization.

**Impact:**
- **Technical:** No correlation IDs, no structured data, no log levels, potential PII leaks
- **Business:** Harder debugging, compliance risks, poor observability

**Recommendation:**
1. Global find/replace `console.log` → `log.info`
2. Replace `console.error` → `log.error` with proper context
3. Add pre-commit hook to prevent new console usage
4. Update ESLint rules to error on console usage

---

#### SEC-001: Unprotected API Routes

**Severity:** Critical  
**Category:** Security  
**Priority Score:** 130  
**Location:** 8 API routes without explicit route protection  
**Effort:** 4 hours
