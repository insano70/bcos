-- Migration: Add Organization Scoping to Dashboards
-- Description: Add organization_id column to dashboards table
--              NULL = Universal dashboard (visible to all organizations)
--              UUID = Organization-specific dashboard (visible only to that org)

-- Add organization_id column (nullable for universal dashboards)
ALTER TABLE dashboards
ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(organization_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Add index for query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_dashboards_organization_id
ON dashboards(organization_id);

-- Add composite index for common query pattern (published + active + org filter)
CREATE INDEX idx_dashboards_published_org
ON dashboards(is_published, organization_id)
WHERE is_active = true;

-- Document the behavior
COMMENT ON COLUMN dashboards.organization_id IS

NULL = Universal dashboard (visible to all organizations).
UUID = Organization-specific dashboard (visible only to members of this organization).
Existing dashboards default to NULL (universal) - no backfill needed.
Data is always filtered at query time via practice_uids, so sharing dashboard configs is secure.
Create org-specific: INSERT ... organization_id = ''uuid''
Create universal: INSERT ... organization_id = NULL
Query filtering: WHERE organization_id IS NULL OR organization_id IN (user_accessible_orgs)';
