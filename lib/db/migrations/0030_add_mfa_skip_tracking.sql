-- Migration: Add MFA Skip Tracking
-- Description: Implements graceful MFA onboarding with skip tracking
-- Author: Claude
-- Date: 2025-01-13
--
-- Purpose: Allow users to skip MFA setup up to 5 times before enforcement.
-- Security: Maintains fail-closed security posture when skips are exhausted.

-- Add MFA skip tracking columns to account_security table
ALTER TABLE account_security
  ADD COLUMN mfa_skips_remaining INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 5,
  ADD COLUMN mfa_skip_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  ADD COLUMN mfa_first_skipped_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  ADD COLUMN mfa_last_skipped_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Add index for efficient MFA enforcement queries
-- Only indexes users without MFA who have exhausted skips
CREATE INDEX idx_account_security_mfa_skips
  ON account_security(mfa_skips_remaining)
  WHERE mfa_enabled = false AND mfa_skips_remaining <= 0;

-- Update existing records to give them 5 skips
-- This maintains backward compatibility for existing users without MFA
UPDATE account_security
SET mfa_skips_remaining = 5
WHERE mfa_enabled = false;

-- Add comments for documentation
