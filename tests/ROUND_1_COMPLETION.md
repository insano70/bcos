## Achievements

### 1. Committed Factory Architecture ✅

Created a robust factory system for testing services that use the global database connection:

#### Core Components Created
- **BaseFactory** - Abstract base class with dependency tracking and scoped cleanup
- **CommittedUserFactory** - User creation with password hashing and unique emails
- **CommittedOrganizationFactory** - Organization creation with unique names and slugs
- **CommittedDashboardFactory** - Dashboard creation with user dependency tracking
- **CommittedChartFactory** - Chart creation with creator dependency tracking

#### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Automatic dependency tracking (charts → users, dashboards → users)
- ✅ Scoped cleanup system for test isolation
- ✅ FK-aware cleanup ordering to avoid constraint violations
- ✅ Database-generated UUIDs with unique identifiers
- ✅ Convenience functions for easy test usage

#### Helper Functions Created
- `assignUserToOrganization()` - Creates user_organization relationships in committed transactions
- `buildUserContext()` - Builds complete RBAC context from database state
- `createTestScope()` - Creates isolated cleanup scope for tests

### 2. RBAC Users Service Testing ✅

**Test File**: [users-service-committed.test.ts](integration/rbac/users-service-committed.test.ts)
**Tests Implemented**: 14
**Pass Rate**: 14/14 (100%)

#### Coverage Areas
- ✅ Read Operations
  - `getUsers()` with real data retrieval
  - `getUserById()` for specific user lookup
  - `getUserCount()` for aggregation
  - Search term filtering
  - Permission denial enforcement

- ✅ Creation Operations
  - `createUser()` with all required fields
  - Organization-scoped permission enforcement
  - Permission denial for unauthorized users

- ✅ Update Operations
  - `updateUser()` with partial updates
  - Organization membership requirements
  - Permission enforcement

- ✅ Deletion Operations
  - `deleteUser()` successful deletion
  - Organization-scoped deletion permissions
  - Permission denial

- ✅ Organization Association Operations
  - `getUsersInOrganization()` filtering
  - `removeUserFromOrganization()` dissociation

#### Key Learnings
- Organization-scoped permissions require users to be assigned to organizations
- Service methods (create/update/delete) need read permissions to return user data
- Helper functions must use global db connection for committed transactions

### 3. RBAC Organizations Service Testing ✅

**Test File**: [organizations-service-committed.test.ts](integration/rbac/organizations-service-committed.test.ts)
**Tests Implemented**: 12
**Pass Rate**: 12/12 (100%)

#### Coverage Areas
- ✅ Read Operations
  - `getOrganizations()` with real data
  - `getOrganizationById()` for specific lookup
  - Search term filtering
  - Permission denial enforcement

- ✅ Single Record Retrieval
  - Specific organization retrieval with valid permissions
  - Access denial without permissions

- ✅ Creation Operations
  - Permission enforcement for `createOrganization()`
  - Note: Service limitation documented where createOrganization requires org access

- ✅ Update Operations
  - `updateOrganization()` successful updates
  - Organization-scoped update permissions
  - Permission denial

- ✅ Deletion Operations
  - `deleteOrganization()` soft deletion
  - Super admin permission requirements
  - Permission denial

- ✅ Hierarchy Operations
  - `getAccessibleHierarchy()` organization trees
  - Organization membership validation

#### Key Learnings
- Organizations use `practices:*` permissions in the system
- createOrganization has a service design limitation (requires org access to return created org)
- Soft deletion (is_active flag) is used instead of hard deletion

### 4. RBAC Data Sources Service Testing ✅

**Test File**: [data-sources-service-committed.test.ts](integration/rbac/data-sources-service-committed.test.ts)
**Tests Implemented**: 11
**Pass Rate**: 11/11 (100%)

#### Coverage Areas
- ✅ Read Operations
  - `getDataSources()` with real data
  - `getDataSourceById()` for specific lookup
  - Search term filtering
  - `analytics:read:organization` permission requirement
  - Permission denial enforcement

- ✅ Single Record Retrieval
  - Specific data source retrieval
  - Null return for non-existent records

- ✅ Creation Operations
  - `createDataSource()` with required fields
  - Database type and schema validation
  - Permission denial for unauthorized users

- ✅ Update Operations
  - `updateDataSource()` successful updates
  - Partial update support
  - Permission enforcement

- ✅ Deletion Operations
  - `deleteDataSource()` soft deletion
  - Verification of soft delete (is_active = false)
  - Permission denial

#### Key Learnings
- Data sources require both `data-sources:*` and `analytics:*` permissions
- getDataSources calls getAccessScope('analytics', 'read') internally
- Data sources use numeric IDs, not UUIDs
- Manual cleanup needed since data sources aren't in factory system yet

```

#### Dependencies & Cleanup System

The committed factory system automatically tracks dependencies and cleans up in the correct order:

```typescript
// Dependency chain example:
Chart → User (creator)
Dashboard → User (creator)
User → Organization (membership)

// Cleanup order (reverse of dependencies):
1. Charts (no dependencies)
2. Dashboards (no dependencies)
3. Users (referenced by charts/dashboards)
4. Organizations (last)
```

### Test Patterns Established

#### Standard Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Service - Basic Committed Tests', () => {
  let scope: ScopedFactoryCollection
  let scopeId: string

  beforeEach(() => {
    scopeId = `test-${nanoid(8)}`
    scope = createTestScope(scopeId)
  })

  afterEach(async () => {
    await scope.cleanup() // Automatic cleanup
  })

  it('should perform operation with permissions', async () => {
    // 1. Create user and org with committed factories
    const user = await createCommittedUser({ scope: scopeId })
    const org = await createCommittedOrganization({ scope: scopeId })

    // 2. Assign user to org (committed)
    await assignUserToOrganization(user, org)

    // 3. Create role and assign to user
    const role = await createTestRole({
      permissions: ['service:action:scope'],
      organizationId: org.organization_id
    })
    await assignRoleToUser(user, role, org)

    // 4. Build user context from database state
    const userContext = await buildUserContext(user, org.organization_id)

    // 5. Create service with context
    const service = createRBACService(userContext)

    // 6. Test service operation
    const result = await service.operation()

    // 7. Assert results
    expect(result).toBeTruthy()
  })
})
```

#### Permission Testing Pattern
```typescript
// Always test both:
// 1. Success case with proper permissions
it('should allow operation with valid permissions', async () => {
  // Setup with correct permissions
  const role = await createTestRole({
    permissions: ['required:permission']
  })
  // ... test passes
})

// 2. Denial case without permissions
it('should deny operation without permissions', async () => {
  const role = await createTestRole({
    permissions: [] // No permissions
  })
  await expect(service.operation()).rejects.toThrow(PermissionDeniedError)
})
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Committed Factory Architecture** - Clean separation between transactional and committed factories
2. **Scoped Cleanup** - Automatic, FK-aware cleanup prevents manual teardown
3. **Dependency Tracking** - Automatic relationship tracking prevents constraint violations
4. **Permission Testing Patterns** - Established clear patterns for RBAC validation
5. **Database-Generated UUIDs** - Letting database generate IDs simplifies logic

### Challenges Overcome 🔧
1. **Transaction Isolation** - Helper functions needed to use global db, not test transactions
2. **Permission Requirements** - Services need multiple permissions (read + write/delete)
3. **Organization Scoping** - Users must be assigned to orgs for scoped permissions
4. **Service Design Limitations** - Some services have quirks (e.g., createOrganization org access)
5. **UUID Generation** - Database generates UUIDs, factories generate unique names/slugs

### Best Practices Established 📋
1. Always use committed factories for service testing
2. Always assign users to organizations for scoped permissions
3. Always include both create/update/delete AND read permissions
4. Always use committed helpers for user-org assignments
5. Always test both success and permission denial cases
6. Always verify TypeScript compilation after changes
7. Always use scoped cleanup for test isolation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-ups
1. **Round 2 Services** - Apply same pattern to:
   - Practices Service
   - Staff Service
   - Templates Service
   - Additional RBAC services

2. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Add edge case coverage (invalid inputs, boundary conditions)
   - Add relationship testing (cross-service dependencies)
   - Add performance regression tests

3. **Factory Expansion**
   - Create committed factories for remaining entities
   - Add data source factory to committed system
   - Document factory creation guidelines

### Long-term Goals
1. Achieve 85%+ code coverage across all services
2. Establish committed factories as standard for service testing
3. Create comprehensive RBAC testing documentation
4. Build automated test generation tools
