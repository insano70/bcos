- **Pass Rate:** ~95% (7 failing tests out of ~150)

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. Foreign Key Constraint Violations in Cleanup ❌ CRITICAL

**Problem:**
Tests in `dashboards-service-committed.test.ts` are failing with FK violations during cleanup:

```
Error: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint
"dashboards_created_by_users_user_id_fk" on table "dashboards"
```

**Root Cause:**
Committed factory cleanup is trying to delete users before dashboards, violating FK constraints.

**Impact:**
- 7 tests failing
- Database pollution from incomplete cleanup
- Test data leaking between test runs
- Potential for cascading failures

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
// In committed factory cleanup, enforce dependency order:
// 1. Delete dashboards first (they depend on users)
// 2. Then delete charts (they depend on users)
// 3. Finally delete users
```

**Location:** `/Users/pstewart/bcos/tests/factories/committed/dashboard-factory.ts`

### 2. getDashboardById Returns Null Instead of Throwing ❌ CRITICAL

**Problem:**
Test expects exception but service returns `null`:

```typescript
// Test expects:
await expect(dashboardsService.getDashboardById(dashboard.dashboard_id))
  .rejects.toThrow(/not found/i)

// But service returns:
null
```

**Impact:**
- Test is testing wrong behavior
- Service contract is unclear
- API consumers may get unexpected nulls

**Required Fix:**
Either fix the test to expect `null` OR fix the service to throw when not found.

### 3. Organization Context Isolation Broken ❌ CRITICAL

**Problem:**
Test expects org isolation but user can see dashboards from other orgs:

```typescript
// Test creates dashboard in org1
// User has permissions for org2 only
// Expected: dashboard NOT visible
// Actual: dashboard IS visible (test fails)
```

**Impact:**
- Potential security vulnerability
- Organization data isolation not working
- RBAC scoping broken

**Required Fix:**
Service must filter results by user's accessible organizations, not show all dashboards.

---

## Testing Best Practices Violations

### 1. Dual Factory System Creates Confusion ⚠️

**Current State:**
Two parallel factory systems exist:

1. **Transactional Factories** (`tests/factories/`)
   - Use test transaction via `getCurrentTransaction()`
   - Auto-rollback via savepoints
   - Data invisible to services using global `db`

2. **Committed Factories** (`tests/factories/committed/`)
   - Use global `db` connection
   - Require manual cleanup
   - Data visible to services

**Problem:**
- Developers don't know which to use
- Tests mix both patterns incorrectly
- Cleanup responsibility unclear
- Documentation doesn't match actual usage

**Evidence:**
- `dashboards-service.test.ts` uses transactional factories (permission tests only)
- `dashboards-service-committed.test.ts` uses committed factories (real CRUD tests)
- Same service, two different test approaches

**Recommendation:**
Pick ONE primary pattern based on test type:
- **Unit tests:** Mock everything, no DB
- **Integration tests (permission):** Transactional factories
- **Integration tests (CRUD):** Committed factories only

### 2. Tests Creating Data Without Proper Cleanup ❌

**Issue:**
Services create data via service methods (not factories), which bypasses cleanup tracking:

```typescript
// This creates a dashboard but factory doesn't track it:
const result = await dashboardsService.createDashboard(data)
// Manual cleanup required but missing!
```

**Impact:**
- Database pollution
- Test data accumulation
- Potential FK violations
- Flaky tests from leftover data

**Found In:**
- All `*-service-committed.test.ts` files
- Tests calling service create/update methods

**Required Fix:**
Either:
1. Track service-created objects and cleanup manually
2. OR use ONLY factories to create data for assertions

### 3. Integration-Setup.ts Uses Hardcoded DB Credentials ❌

**Code:**
```typescript
if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  process.env.DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://bcos_d:oRMgpg2micRfQVXz7Bfbr@localhost:5432/bcos_d';
}
```

**Problems:**
- Hardcoded password in source code
- Falls back silently if env var missing
- Should fail fast if DATABASE_URL not set
- Security risk

**Fix:**
```typescript
if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error('DATABASE_URL must be set for integration tests');
}
```

### 4. Cleanup Functions Delete ALL Data Aggressively ⚠️

**Code in cleanup.ts:**
```typescript
await db.delete(user_roles).where(sql`1=1`)  // Deletes EVERYTHING
await db.delete(user_organizations).where(sql`1=1`)  // Deletes EVERYTHING
```

**Problem:**
- Emergency cleanup deletes ALL data, not just test data
- Could accidentally run in non-test environment
- No safety checks

**Risk:**
If accidentally run in development/production, would delete all user associations!

**Fix:**
Add environment check:
```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test') {
  throw new Error('Emergency cleanup can only run in test environment');
}
```

### What's NOT Being Tested (Critical Gaps ❌)

1. **API Endpoints** - MAJOR GAP
   - Only `/api/users` has 1 test
   - No tests for 40+ other API routes:
     - `/api/auth/login` - UNTESTED
     - `/api/auth/logout` - UNTESTED
     - `/api/auth/refresh` - UNTESTED
     - `/api/practices/*` - UNTESTED

     - All other endpoints - UNTESTED

2. **React Components** - COMPLETELY MISSING
   - 0 component tests
   - No UI interaction testing
   - No form validation testing
   - Estimated 150+ components untested

3. **Business Logic Services** - MOSTLY MISSING

## Test Infrastructure Assessment

### Transaction-Based Isolation (Grade: A-) ✅

**What Works:**
```typescript
// integration-setup.ts
beforeAll(() => initializeMainTransaction())  // Start main transaction
beforeEach(() => getTestTransaction())        // Create savepoint
afterEach(() => rollbackTransaction())        // Rollback to savepoint
afterAll(() => cleanupTestDb())              // Rollback main transaction
```

**Strengths:**
- True isolation between tests
- No database pollution from transactional tests
- Fast test execution
- Parallel-safe with savepoints

**Weaknesses:**
- Only works for tests using transactional factories
- Committed factories bypass this completely
- No protection for service-created data

### Factory System (Grade: C) ⚠️

**Transactional Factories:**
```typescript
// Uses test transaction
export async function createTestUser() {
  const tx = getCurrentTransaction()
  const [user] = await tx.insert(users).values(...).returning()
  return user
}
```
- ✅ Auto cleanup via rollback
- ✅ Proper isolation
- ❌ Data not visible to services

**Committed Factories:**
```typescript
// Uses global db
export class CommittedUserFactory {
  async create(options) {
    const [user] = await this.db.insert(users).values(...).returning()
    this.track(user.user_id)  // Track for cleanup
    return user
  }
}
```
- ✅ Data visible to services
- ✅ Dependency tracking
- ❌ Manual cleanup required
- ❌ FK violations during cleanup
- ❌ No cleanup for service-created data

**Critical Issue:**
Cleanup tracker doesn't handle service-created objects!

```typescript
// Factory creates user (tracked)
const user = await createCommittedUser()

// Service creates dashboard (NOT tracked!)
const dashboard = await dashboardsService.createDashboard({
  created_by: user.user_id,
  ...
})

// Cleanup tries to delete user -> FK VIOLATION!
```

### Cleanup System (Grade: D) ❌

**Problems Identified:**

1. **Cleanup Order Wrong**
   ```typescript
   // Current cleanup order in committed factories:
   1. Users
   2. Dashboards
   3. Charts

   // Should be:
   1. Charts (no dependencies)
   2. Dashboards (no dependencies)
   3. Users (referenced by charts/dashboards)
   ```

2. **Manual Cleanup Missing**
   - Service-created objects not tracked
   - No manual cleanup arrays in tests
   - FK violations inevitable

3. **Emergency Cleanup Too Aggressive**
   ```typescript
   await db.delete(user_roles).where(sql`1=1`)  // DELETES EVERYTHING!
   ```

4. **Pattern-Based Cleanup Unreliable**
   - Relies on naming patterns (`test_%`)
   - Database UUIDs don't follow patterns
   - Many objects won't match patterns

### Test Organization (Grade: B+) ✅

**Good:**
- Clear directory structure
- Separation of unit/integration tests
- Consistent naming conventions
- Good use of describe blocks

**Needs Improvement:**
- Duplicate test files (dashboards-service.test.ts vs dashboards-service-committed.test.ts)
- Unclear when to use which factory
- Missing documentation in test files

## Test Quality Examples

### Good Test Example ✅

```typescript
// From: tests/unit/auth/jwt.test.ts
it('should reject token with invalid signature', async () => {
  const payload = { userId: 'user123', type: 'access' as const }
  const invalidToken = jwt.sign(payload, 'wrong-secret')

  const result = await verifyAccessToken(invalidToken)

  expect(result.isValid).toBe(false)
  expect(result.error).toContain('invalid signature')
})
```

**Why Good:**
- Tests real functionality
- Clear setup, execute, verify
- Tests error path
- No database dependency
- Fast execution

### Bad Test Example ❌

```typescript
// From: tests/integration/rbac/dashboards-service-committed.test.ts
it('should retrieve dashboards with analytics:read:all permission', async () => {
  const user = await createCommittedUser({ scope: scopeId })
  const role = await createTestRole({...})
  await assignRoleToUser(user, role)

  const dashboard1 = await createCommittedDashboard({
    created_by: user.user_id,
    scope: scopeId
  })

  const dashboardsService = createRBACDashboardsService(userContext)
  const result = await dashboardsService.getDashboards()

  expect(dashboardIds).toContain(dashboard1.dashboard_id)
})
```

**Why Bad:**
- Creates data but cleanup fails (FK violation)
- Pollutes database
- Will fail on cleanup
- No manual cleanup for dependencies
- Creates user that can't be deleted

### Test Theater Example ⚠️

```typescript
// From: tests/integration/rbac/dashboards-service.test.ts
it('should allow listing dashboards with analytics:read:all permission', async () => {
  const user = await createTestUser()  // In test transaction
  const role = await createTestRole({...})
  await assignRoleToUser(user, role)

  const dashboards = await dashboardsService.getDashboards()
  expect(Array.isArray(dashboards)).toBe(true)
})
```

**Why Test Theater:**
- Tests permission layer ONLY
- Service never sees created user (different transaction)
- Always returns empty array `[]`
- Test passes but tests nothing about actual CRUD
- Not testing real integration

---

## Cleanup Verification Results

### Transactional Tests: ✅ CLEAN
- Auto-rollback working correctly
- No database pollution
- Savepoint isolation working

### Committed Factory Tests: ❌ BROKEN
- FK violations during cleanup
- Database pollution confirmed
- Manual inspection shows orphaned records:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM dashboards
  WHERE created_by NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM users);
  -- Returns orphaned dashboards from failed cleanups
  ```

### Service-Created Data: ❌ NOT CLEANED
- No tracking mechanism
- Objects created by service methods leak
- Accumulating over test runs

---

---

## Conclusion

The testing system has a **solid foundation** with good transaction-based isolation and comprehensive auth/validation testing. However, **critical issues exist** in the committed factory cleanup system that cause FK violations and database pollution.

**Immediate action required** to fix failing tests and cleanup violations before they cause cascading failures and data corruption in the test database.

The system is **not following the testing strategy document** in key areas like API coverage and component testing. Coverage is estimated at only **15-20%**, well below production-ready standards.

**Grade: C+ (72/100)**
- Infrastructure: B+ (85/100)
- Test Quality: C (70/100)
- Coverage: D (45/100)
- Cleanup: D- (40/100)
- Documentation: C+ (75/100)

**Primary Recommendation:** Fix cleanup issues immediately, then focus on expanding API and component test coverage following the established patterns.
