# Flexible Workflow Task Tracking System
## Design Document

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a highly extensible Next.js-based workflow and task tracking system. The core architecture emphasizes reusability, dynamic configuration, and flexibility to accommodate diverse workflow patterns across different business processes.

---

## System Overview

### Core Principles

**Reusability**: Core workflow engine operates independently of specific business logic, allowing the same system to power multiple workflow types simultaneously.

**Extensibility**: New workflow types, fields, and integrations can be added without modifying core system architecture.

**Type-Driven Configuration**: Workflow behavior is determined by configuration rather than hardcoded logic.

**Data Flexibility**: Support for dynamic custom fields that can be defined per workflow type or even per individual work item.

---

## High-Level Architecture

### Application Layers

**Presentation Layer**: Next.js frontend with server components and client components for interactive experiences.

**API Layer**: Next.js API routes serving as the backend, handling business logic and orchestrating services.

**Service Layer**: Reusable business logic modules that can be composed to handle different workflow operations.

**Data Access Layer**: Abstraction over database operations, providing a consistent interface regardless of storage mechanism.

**Integration Layer**: Connectors for external services including S3, third-party APIs, and external data sources.

### Deployment Architecture

**Database**: Relational database supporting JSON/JSONB fields for dynamic data (PostgreSQL recommended).

**Object Storage**: AWS S3 for document storage with presigned URLs for secure access.

**Cache Layer**: Redis or similar for session management, real-time updates, and performance optimization.

**Queue System**: Message queue for asynchronous operations like notifications, document processing, and external API calls.

## Core Components

### Workflow Engine

The heart of the system responsible for orchestrating work item lifecycle and transitions.

**State Machine Manager**: Manages valid state transitions based on workflow type configuration, enforces business rules, validates transition prerequisites, and triggers side effects.

**Workflow Definition Registry**: Stores and retrieves workflow type definitions, manages versioning of workflow schemas, and handles inheritance and extension of base workflow types.

**Transition Validator**: Checks user permissions for transitions, validates required field completion, enforces conditional logic, and runs custom validation rules.

**Event Dispatcher**: Publishes events for state changes, triggers notifications and webhooks, enables audit trail creation, and facilitates integration hooks.

### Work Item Management

**Work Item Factory**: Creates work items based on type definitions, initializes default values and required fields, establishes relationships between work items, and generates unique identifiers.

**Work Item Repository**: CRUD operations for work items, query builder for complex searches and filters, optimized retrieval with eager/lazy loading, and bulk operations support.

**Version Control System**: Tracks changes to work item data, maintains complete audit history, supports rollback capabilities, and handles concurrent modification conflicts.

**Relationship Manager**: Manages parent-child relationships, handles blocking/blocked by dependencies, supports custom relationship types, and maintains referential integrity.

### Dynamic Field System

**Field Definition Schema**: Type system supporting text, numeric, date, boolean, select, multi-select, and complex nested objects. Configuration for validation rules, conditional visibility, and computed values.

**Field Renderer Factory**: Dynamically generates appropriate UI components based on field type, handles custom field layouts, supports field grouping and sections, and manages responsive behavior.

**Field Validator**: Real-time validation during data entry, cross-field validation logic, async validation for external data checks, and localized error messaging.

**Field Value Store**: Efficient storage of dynamic field values using JSON/JSONB columns, indexing strategy for searchable custom fields, and migration support for schema changes.

### Document Management

**Upload Service**: Multipart upload support for large files, virus scanning integration, file type validation and restrictions, and automatic thumbnail generation for images.

**Storage Adapter**: Abstraction over S3 operations, presigned URL generation for secure downloads, lifecycle management for temporary files, and support for multiple storage backends.

**Document Metadata Store**: Tracks document associations with work items, stores checksums for integrity verification, maintains upload/modification history, and supports tagging and categorization.

**Access Control Manager**: Permission checks for document access, sharing capabilities with expiration, audit logging of document access, and encryption at rest and in transit.

### External Integration Framework

**Data Source Connectors**: REST API client with retry logic, GraphQL query support, Database connection pooling, and authentication/authorization handling.

**Data Mapping Engine**: Transforms external data to internal schema, handles field mapping configurations, supports data enrichment rules, and manages bi-directional sync.

**Webhook Manager**: Registers and manages incoming webhooks, validates webhook signatures, queues webhook processing, and provides webhook debugging tools.

**Integration Registry**: Catalog of available integrations, configuration templates per integration type, health monitoring and status reporting, and rate limiting and quota management.

---

## Data Model Design

### Core Entities

**WorkflowType**: Defines workflow schema and behavior including unique identifier and name, state machine definition with allowed transitions, field definitions and requirements, permission rules per state, and lifecycle hooks configuration.

**WorkItem**: Individual unit of work including workflow type reference, current state in workflow, dynamic field values as JSON, ownership and assignment, timestamps for creation/updates, and priority and due date information.

**FieldDefinition**: Schema for custom fields including field name and type, validation rules, conditional display logic, default values, and ordering and grouping.

**WorkItemHistory**: Audit trail including timestamp of change, user who made change, previous and new values, transition information, and comment or description.

**Document**: File attachments including reference to work item, S3 object key, file metadata (size, type, name), upload timestamp and user, and access permissions.

**Integration**: External system connections including integration type and provider, authentication credentials (encrypted), field mapping configuration, sync schedule and rules, and last sync timestamp.

### Relationships and Constraints

Work items can have parent-child relationships with multiple levels of nesting. Work items can reference other work items through configurable relationship types. Documents belong to exactly one work item. Field definitions belong to workflow types but can be overridden at the work item level. History entries are immutable and linked to work items. Integrations can be scoped to specific workflow types or globally available.
