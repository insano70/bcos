# COMPLETE System Analysis: Every Single Difference

**Purpose:** Document ALL differences between individual (working) and batch (broken) rendering  
**Method:** Complete code reading of both full flows  
**Status:** Analysis in progress - building comprehensive comparison

---

## Analysis Plan

I'm going to trace through:

1. **Individual Flow (Working):**
   - dashboard-view → AnalyticsChart → useChartData → /chart-data/universal → orchestrator → handler → transform → ChartRenderer → dual-axis-chart component

2. **Batch Flow (Current State):**
   - dashboard-view → useDashboardData → /dashboard/render → DashboardRenderer → orchestrator → handler → transform → BatchChartRenderer → ChartRenderer → dual-axis-chart component

3. **Document EVERY step where they differ**

4. **Special focus on:**
   - Multi-series charts (you said completely unsupported)
   - Missing basic functionality
   - Why dual-axis still broken after fixes

This will take time to do properly. I'm reading through all the code files now to build the complete picture.

## Files Being Analyzed

### Individual System:
1. components/charts/dashboard-view.tsx (lines 336-359)
2. components/charts/analytics-chart.tsx (complete)
3. hooks/use-chart-data.ts (complete)
4. app/api/admin/analytics/chart-data/universal/route.ts
5. lib/services/chart-data-orchestrator.ts
6. lib/services/chart-handlers/* (all handlers)
7. components/charts/chart-renderer.tsx
8. components/charts/analytics-dual-axis-chart.tsx
9. components/charts/responsive-chart-container.tsx

### Batch System:
1. components/charts/dashboard-view.tsx (lines 320-334)
2. hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts
3. app/api/admin/analytics/dashboard/[dashboardId]/render/route.ts
4. lib/services/dashboard-renderer.ts
