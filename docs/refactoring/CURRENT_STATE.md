## Refactoring Pattern Established

Based on organizations service success:

### File Structure Template
```
lib/services/{resource}/
├── index.ts                    # Barrel exports (~30 lines)
├── {resource}-service.ts       # Main composite (~150 lines)
├── base-service.ts             # Shared permissions (~130 lines)
├── core-service.ts             # CRUD operations (~700 lines)
├── {domain}-service.ts         # Specialized services as needed
└── query-builder.ts            # Query helpers (if complex)
```

### Core Principles
1. Extend `BaseRBACService` via custom base service
2. Cache all permissions in base class constructor
3. Provide shared RBAC filtering methods
4. Separate CRUD from specialized operations
5. Use composition in main service (delegate to sub-services)
6. Maintain backward compatibility via barrel exports

## Known Issues to Address

### Import Order Violations
Many services still have import order violations. Must fix during refactoring:
- ❌ Errors first (should be 4th)
- ❌ Logging mixed with database imports
- ❌ Missing section comments

### Permission Duplication
Pattern found in multiple services:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Manual permission checking (found in 20+ services)
constructor(userContext: UserContext) {
  this.canReadAll = 
    userContext.is_super_admin ||
    userContext.all_permissions?.some(p => p.name === '...') || false;
}

// ✅ GOOD - Extend base service
constructor(userContext: UserContext) {
  super(userContext);
  // Permissions inherited and cached
}
```

## Metrics

### Overall Progress
- **Completed:** 1 service (Organizations)
- **In Progress:** 1 service (Work Items)
- **Pending:** 5+ services
- **Total Large Services (>600 lines):** 7

### Code Quality Improvements (Organizations)
- **Before:** 2,385 lines total
- **After:** 1,892 lines total
- **Reduction:** 493 lines (21%)
- **Duplication removed:** 55 lines (100%)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Work Items refactoring**
   - Make helper method placement decision
   - Extract core-service.ts completely
   - Follow remaining phases in plan

2. **Apply pattern to remaining services**
   - Use organizations as template
   - Document each refactoring
   - Maintain quality standards

3. **Update STANDARDS.md examples**
   - Add work-items as "Very Complex" example
   - Document helper method patterns
   - Add decision framework for service splitting
